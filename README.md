### What I learned
During this project, I gained experience in creating responsive layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid. I also practiced using CSS custom properties to create reusable styles. It was a good opportunity to strengthen my skills in HTML markup and CSS styling.

### Continued development
In future projects, I would like to further explore advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions, to enhance the user experience. I also plan to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript and learn front-end frameworks like React.
